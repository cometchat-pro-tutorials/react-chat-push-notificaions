# For Mayer

Hi Mayer. I uploaded a snapshot of my code including:

* node_modules
* .env
* And my Firebase `config` is embedded in firebase.js and firebase-messaging-sw.js


To run the app:

```
git clone https://github.com/cometchat-pro-tutorials/react-chat-push-notifications
git checkout mayur
npm run start
```

Then login as "superhero1"
